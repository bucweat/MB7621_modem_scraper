# MB7621_modem_scraper
Python project to scrap Motorola MB7621 webpage info, save to sqlite db and do some charting. I have been having problems with my cable internet service, and one of the troubleshooting steps I took was to purchase a new modem. Still had the same problems. So I decided to embark on a project to learn python coding/charting, jupyter lab, web scraping and github. The files that will eventually show up here are the results of my efforts.

Please have patience as I clean up the code and get it all uploaded to github. Thanks.
