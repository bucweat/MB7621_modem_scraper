# MB7621_modem_scraper
Python project to scrap Motorola MB7621 webpage info, save to sqlite db and do some charting. 

I have been having problems with my cable internet service, and one of the troubleshooting steps I took was to purchase a new modem. Still had the same problems. In order to convince my cable company that there were issues that had nothing to do with modem or house, I decided to collect some data. To that end I embarked on a project to learn python coding/charting, jupyter lab, web scraping and github. Before you are the fruits of my labor. 

## What's Here?

- MB7621 is a python module that contains all the webpage scrapping code.
