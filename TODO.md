TODO list

- Keep track of changes to the event log and only add to the sqlite db when a new entry is found.
- Update basic and sw in sqlite db less frequently since they shouldn't change that often.
- Statistics on the upstream and downstream tables
- Track deltas for corrected and uncorrected counts and correlate to time to generate change events so that they can be compared to power levels.
- More to come...
